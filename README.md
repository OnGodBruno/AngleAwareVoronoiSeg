# 3D Mesh Segmentation

Python code for curvature-aware 3D mesh segmentation using `trimesh`, `networkx`, and `numpy`.

## Features

✅ Segments 3D models based on spatial distance and curvature  
✅ Adjustable penalty for curvature differences  
✅ Outputs segmented `.obj` files  
✅ Configurable number of Segments

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-mesh-segmentation.git
